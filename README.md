TWITTER BOOTSTRAP - SASS
=================

Bootstrap is Twitter's toolkit for kickstarting CSS for websites, apps, and more. It includes base CSS styles for typography, forms, buttons, tables, grids, navigation, alerts, and more. I have forked their original project which can be found at http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap! and reworked it into SASS. I don't have anything against LESS but I am currently using SASS in so many projects that it seemed sensible to port this over so that I could use the components separately.


Usage
-----

You can use this port of the Twitter Bootstrap in one of two ways: just drop the compiled CSS into any new project or if you are already using SASS just include the SASS files on a case by case basis into your project. The files are named in a fairly self explanatory way so it should be pretty simple to work out what you need. 


``` html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="bootstrap.css">
```
